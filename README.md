# Python OpenCV Example

This project is a basic implementation of OpenCV library.
It can detect and match the image from webcam frame and dictionaries.

# How to setup

Using the `virtualenv` is an encouragement. How ever, if you have Windows Machine, just simply run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to run

To run this program, just tell python to run `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

If you don't want to open the window:

```bash
python main.py disable-window
```

# TODO List
- [ ] Run match algorithm asynchronously
- [ ] Integrate with Database
